When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repository is very useful in collaborating project when multiple people are accessing and commiting to the project. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because the changes I made may not be the final changes which I want.
